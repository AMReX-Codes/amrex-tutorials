# INTEGRATION
## integration.type can take on the following values:
## 0 or "ForwardEuler" => Native AMReX Forward Euler integrator
## 1 or "RungeKutta"   => Native AMReX Explicit Runge Kutta controlled by integration.rk.type
## 2 or "SUNDIALS"     => SUNDIALS backend controlled by integration.sundials.strategy
integration.type = ForwardEuler
