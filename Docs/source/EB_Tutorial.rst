==========================

``amrex-tutorials/ExampleCodes/EB/CNS`` is an AMR code for solving compressible
Navier-Stokes equations with the embedded boundary approach.

``amrex-tutorials/ExampleCodes/EB/Poisson`` is a single-level code that is a proxy for
solving the electrostatic Poisson equation for a grounded sphere with a point
charge inside.
