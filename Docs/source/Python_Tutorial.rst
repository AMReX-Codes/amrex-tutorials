These examples show how to use AMReX from Python.
AMReX applications can also be interfaced to Python with the same logic.

In order to build the Python tutorials, add ``-DTUTORIAL_PYTHON=ON`` to the CMake configuration options.
Then install with ``cmake --build build --target pyamrex_pip_install``.

Examples:

- ``GuidedTutorials/MultiFab/main.py``

Please see `pyAMReX <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/pyamrex/>`__ for more details.
