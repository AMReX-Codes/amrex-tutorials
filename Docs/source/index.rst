AMReX Guided Tutorials and Example Codes
========================================

Welcome to AMReX Tutorials and Example Codes. The goal of this information
is to enable users to write their own AMReX code. This is split into 
two tracks, Guided Tutorials and Example Codes.

Guided Tutorials
----------------

Guided tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to AMReX 
features by focusing on key concepts in a progressive way. They are designed
to be followed from start to finish. They will focus on a few specific goals
of larger importance to using AMReX rather than explain every line of code.

Example Codes
-------------

Example codes are provided for users who are already comfortable with the
general AMReX framework. The goal of sharing them here, is to facilitate 
understanding by reading straightforward application of AMReX features, and
to provide a starting place for user's to develop their unique applications. 
We present here a wide range of examples in the hope that you will find 
code applicable to your situation.

AMReX is a software framework library containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available at https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.

There is extensive documentation for AMReX at :ref:`amrex_docs:amrex_doc_indx`

AMReX Tutorials are a set of small stand-alone example codes that demonstrate how
to use different parts of the AMReX functionality. You can also work through a set
of AMReX tutorials online `here <https://github.com/atmyers/ecp-tutorials>`_, without
needing to install any dependencies or download any code to your local machine. For
accompanying slides, see `here <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorial_slides.pdf>`_.

We are always happy to have users contribute to AMReX Tutorials as well as
the AMReX source code. To contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch
(details at https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).


The amrex/Tutorials directory is broken into the following categories:
