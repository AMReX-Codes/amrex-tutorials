AMReX Guided Tutorials and Example Codes
========================================

Welcome to AMReX Tutorials and Example Codes. The goal of this information
is to enable users to write their own AMReX code. This is split into 
two tracks, Guided Tutorials and Example Codes.

Guided Tutorials
----------------

Guided tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to AMReX 
features by focusing on key concepts in a progressive way. They are designed
to be followed from start to finish. They will focus on a few specific goals
of larger importance to using AMReX rather than explain every line of code.

Example Codes
-------------

Example codes are provided for users who are already comfortable with the
general AMReX framework. The goal of sharing them here, is to facilitate 
understanding by reading straightforward application of AMReX features, and
to provide a starting place for user's to develop their unique applications. 
We present here a wide range of examples in the hope that you will find 
code applicable to your situation.
