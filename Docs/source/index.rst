AMReX Guided Tutorials and Example Codes
========================================

Welcome to AMReX Tutorials and Example Codes. Here you will find
a progression of hands on demonstrations and useful stand-alone examples
designed to assist users in learning and writing their own AMReX code.
For additional details on the topics presented here, please see the
`AMReX Source Documentation`_. The resources are divided into two categories:

Guided Tutorials
----------------

Guided tutorials provide a gentle introduction to AMReX
features by focusing on key concepts in a progressive way. They are designed
to be followed from start to finish. They will focus on a few specific goals
of larger importance to using AMReX rather than comment on every line of code.

Example Codes
-------------

Example codes are stand-alone examples that demonstrate how to use
different parts of the AMReX functionality. They are aimed at
users who are comfortable with the basics of AMReX.
They present a straightforward application of AMReX features, and
provide a starting place for user's to develop their unique applications.

The example codes listed below are provided in the ``AMReX-Codes/amrex-tutorials`` repo,
under the directory ``amrex-tutorials/ExampleCodes``. The examples are
sorted by the following categories:

- :ref:`AMR<tutorials_amr>` -- Examples of adaptive mesh refinement.
- :ref:`Basic<tutorials_basic>` -- Fundamental operations supported by AMReX.

  Conduit Mesh Blueprint for use with the ALPINE Ascent in situ visualization
  and analysis tool.
- :ref:`EB<tutorials_eb>`  -- Examples of embedded boundaries.
- :ref:`FFTW<tutorials_fftw>`  -- FFTW and cuFFT single-rank tutorials.
