AMReX Guided Tutorials and Example Codes
========================================

Welcome to AMReX Tutorials and Example Codes. The goal of the information
presented here is to assist users in writing their own AMReX code by
providing a progression of hands on demonstrations and useful example codes. Users
will find the `AMReX Source Documentation`_ helpful for explaining
any topics in greater detail.  We divide the resources here into two categories
described below.

Guided Tutorials
----------------

Guided tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to AMReX
features by focusing on key concepts in a progressive way. They are designed
to be followed from start to finish. They will focus on a few specific goals
of larger importance to using AMReX rather than explain every line of code.

Example codes are provided for users who are already comfortable with the
general AMReX framework. The goal of sharing them here, is to facilitate
understanding by presenting a straightforward application of AMReX features, and
to provide a starting place for user's to develop their unique applications.
