Tutorials/ML
==========================

In ML/PYTORCH there is an example of using a pre-trained PyTorch model in the
AMReX framework.  In this example we initialize data on a MultiFab, copy
the data into a PyTorch tensor, call the model, and load the result back
into a MultiFab.  The example works on both the host and GPU.
A model is included as an example (``/Exec/model.pt``).
See ``ML/PYTORCH/README.md`` for ``libtorch`` download instructions.
