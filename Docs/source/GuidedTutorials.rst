repo, under the parent directory ``amrex-tutorials/GuidedTutorials``.


:ref:`Hello World<guided_hello_world>`
--------------------------------------

This tutorial explains how to build AMReX HelloWorld.


---------

:ref:`The MultiFab<multifab_tutorial>`
--------------------------------------

This tutorial introduces the AMReX MultiFab class. It demonstrates
how to create a MultiFab, fill it with data and write that data
to a plotfile.


---------

:ref:`Heat Equation -- Simple<guided_heat_simple>`
--------------------------------------------------

A complete build-run-visualize workflow walk-through. This simplified introduction
covers several basic components of AMReX while minimizing required knowledge of C++
syntax.

|

:ref:`Namespaces and Multidimensional Code<name_multidim>`
----------------------------------------------------------

This code expands upon the Heat Equation -- Simple tutorial by adding a
namespace scope, macros and preprocessor directives to simplify syntax and enable
2 or 3-dimensinal simulation from the same code. These additions bring the syntax
closer to typical practice.

|

:ref:`Heat Equation<guided_heat>`
---------------------------------

This tutorial revisits AMReX's approach to heat equation in additional detail with
preprocessor variables, scoped namespaces, and multiple source files
to demonstrate additional convenience and functionality.

`Tutorials from the 2021 ECP Annual Meeting`_
---------------------------------------------

It's also possible to work through several tutorials on AMReX that were presented
at the 2021 ECP Annual Meeting without needing to install any dependencies or
download any code to your local machine. The tutorials are available in the GitHub repo,
`ECP-Tutorials <https://github.com/atmyers/ecp-tutorials>`_ and use the GitPod
cloud dev environment. For accompanying slides, see
`tutorial_slides.pdf <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorial_slides.pdf>`_.
