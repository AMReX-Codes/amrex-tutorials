---------

`Heat Equation -- Simple`_
--------------------------

A complete build-run-visualize workflow walk-through. This simplified introduction
covers several basic components of AMReX while minimizing required knowledge of c++
syntax.

`Heat Equation`_ 
----------------

This tutorial revisits AMReX's approach to heat equation in additional detail with
preprocessor variables, scoped namespaces, and multiple source files 
to demonstrate additional convenience and functionality.

---------

`Advection with Adaptive Mesh Refinement`_
------------------

Adaptive mesh refinement code that advects 
a single scalar field with a velocity field specified on faces. It also has an option
to use MAC projection to enforce that the specified velocity field is 
discretely divergence-free.
