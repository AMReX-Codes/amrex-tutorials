Advection_AmrCore: This tutorial contains an AMR advection code that advects a single 
scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

It also has an option to use the MAC projection to enforce that the specified
velocity field is discretely divergence-free.

It is an AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, and AmrCore directories.
To see a similar example that uses amrex/Src/Amr rather than AmrCore, see
the tutorial in amrex/Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrLevel.

Each directorie --  Exec/SingleVortex and Exec/SingleVortexProjected --
includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from 
https://github.com/amrex-codes/amrvis) or with VisIt, yt or Paraview.
