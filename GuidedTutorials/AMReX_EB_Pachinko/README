This tutorial demonstrates particles accelerating downward with
gravity and bouncing off the side walls and off the solid obstacles.

We can build the executable in 2-d or 3-d.  In this example the problem
is the same in both cases since we assume the particles never move in the z-direction.

****************************************************************************************************

In this example we freeze the obstacles but can change the initial particle locations.

To run it in serial, 

./main3d.ex inputs_3d

To run it in parallel, for example on 4 ranks:

mpirun -n 4 ./main3d.ex inputs_3d

The following parameters can be set at run-time -- these are currently set in the inputs_3d
file but you can also set them on the command line.  In this specific example we use only 4
cells in the z-direction (if in 3-d) regardless of n_cell.

```
n_cell = 125                             # number of cells in x-direction; we double this in the y-direction
max_grid_size = 25                       # the maximum number of cells in any direction in a single grid

plot_int = 10                            # frequency of writing plotfiles

particle_file = initial_particles_3d     # name of file where we specify the input positions of the particles

time_step = 0.001                        # we take a fixed time step of this size

max_time  = 3.0                          # the final time (if max_time < max_steps * time_step)
max_steps = 100000                       # the maximum number of steps (if max_steps * time_step < max_time))
```

For example, 
```
mpirun -n 4 ./main3d.ex inputs_3d particle_file=my_file
```

will read the particles from a file called "my_file"

****************************************************************************************************

The output from your run should look something like this:

```
********************************************************************
 Let's advect the particles ...
   We'll print a dot every 10 time steps.

We've finished moving the particles to time 3
That took 1.145916707 seconds.
