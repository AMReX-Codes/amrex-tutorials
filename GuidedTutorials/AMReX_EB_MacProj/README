"Off to the Races"

This tutorial demonstrates the solution of a Poisson equation
to compute a potential flow field obstacles,  then the use of this 
flow field to advect particles from left to right around the obstacles.

To run it in serial, 

./main3d.ex inputs

To run it in parallel, for example on 4 ranks:

mpirun -n 4 ./main3d.ex inputs

The following parameters can be set at run-time -- these are currently set in the inputs
file but you can also set them on the command line.  


n_cell = 128                             # number of cells in x-direction; we double this in the y-direction
max_grid_size = 64                       # the maximum number of cells in any direction in a single grid

plot_int = 10                            # frequency of writing plotfiles

particle_file = initial_particles_3d     # name of file where we specify the input positions of the particles

time_step = 0.001                        # we advance the particles with a fixed time step of this size

max_time = 10.0                          # the final time (if max_time < max_steps * time_step)

max_steps = 10000                        # the maximum number of steps (if max_steps * time_step < max_time))

obstacles = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8            # this is how we choose which obstacles to include

The output from your run should look something like this:


********************************************************************
 You specified 9 objects in the domain: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

********************************************************************
 First let's project the initial velocity to find
   the flow field around the obstacles ...
********************************************************************


********************************************************************
 Done!  Now let's advect the particles ...
