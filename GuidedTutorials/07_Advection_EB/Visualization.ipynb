    "## Example: \"AMR102: Advection of Particles Around Obstacles\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Features Are We Using\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mesh data with EB \n",
    "* Linear solvers (multigrid)\n",
    "* Particle-Mesh interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall our previous problem of the drop of dye in a thin incompressible fluid that is spinning \n",
    "clock-wise then counter-clockwise with a prescribed motion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now instead of advecting the dye as a scalar quantity defined on the mesh (the\n",
    "continuum representation), we define the dye as a collection of particles that\n",
    "are advected by the fluid velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again the fluid is thin enough that we can model this as two-dimensional\n",
    "motion; again we have the option of solving in a 2D or 3D computational domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things even more interesting, there is now an object in the flow, in this case a cylinder.\n",
    "It would be very difficult to analytically specify the flow field around the object, so instead \n",
    "we project the velocity field so that the resulting field represents incompressible flow around the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projecting the Velocity for Incompressible Flow around the Cylinder\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, projecting the specified velocity field means solving  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla \\cdot (\\beta \\nabla \\xi)  = \\nabla \\cdot \\bf{u^{spec}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and setting \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bf{u} = \\bf{u^{spec}} - \\beta \\nabla \\xi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this variable coefficient Poisson equation, we use the native AMReX geometric multigrid solver.\n",
    "In our case $\\beta = 1 / \\rho = 1$ since we are assuming constant density $\\rho.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this example we are solving everything at a single level for convenience,\n",
    "but linear solvers, EB and particles all have full multi-level functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each timestep we compute the projected velocity field, advect the particles with this velocity, then interpolate the particles onto the mesh to determine $\\phi(x,y,z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Particle-In-Cell Algorithm for Advecting $\\phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "We achieve conservation by interpreting the scalar $\\phi$ as the number\n",
    "density of physical dye particles in the fluid, and we represent these physical\n",
    "particles by \"computational\" particles $p$. Each particle $p$ stores a\n",
    "weight $w_p$ equal to the number of physical dye particles it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to define particle-mesh interpolation that converts\n",
    "$\\phi(x,y,z)$ to a set of particles with weights $w_p$. First, we\n",
    "interpolate $\\phi(x,y,z)$ to $\\phi_p$ at each particle location by\n",
    "calculating:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_p = \\sum_i \\sum_j \\sum_k S_x \\cdot S_y \\cdot S_z \\cdot \\phi(i,j,k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where in the above, $S_{x,y,z}$ are called shape factors, determined by the\n",
    "particle-in-cell interpolation scheme we wish to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest interpolation is nearest grid point (NGP), where $S_{x,y,z} = 1$\n",
    "if the particle $p$ is within cell $(i,j,k)$ and $S_{x,y,z} = 0$\n",
    "otherwise. An alternative is linear interpolation called cloud-in-cell (CIC),\n",
    "where the shape factors are determined by volume-weighting the particle's\n",
    "contribution to/from the nearest 8 cells (in 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have interpolated $\\phi(x,y,z)$ to the particle to get $\\phi_p$, we\n",
    "scale it by the volume per particle to get the number of physical dye particles\n",
    "that our computational particle represents. Here, $n_{ppc}$ is the number of\n",
    "computational particles per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_p = \\phi_p \\cdot \\dfrac{dx dy dz}{n_{ppc}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To go back from the particle representation to the grid representation, we\n",
    "reverse this procedure by summing up the number of physical dye particles in\n",
    "each grid cell and dividing by the grid cell volume. This recovers the number\n",
    "density $\\phi(x,y,z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(i,j,k) = \\dfrac{1}{dx dy dz} \\cdot \\sum_p S_x \\cdot S_y \\cdot S_z \\cdot w_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is the basis for Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods in a variety of\n",
    "fields, and in this tutorial you can experiment with the number of particles\n",
    "per cell and interpolation scheme to see how well you can resolve the dye\n",
    "advection."
